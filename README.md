## 🌟 What is GMWF?

**GMWF** is an enterprise management system designed specifically for the **Gulzar Madina Welfare Foundation**. It connects healthcare clinics, educational facilities, community welfare services, and financial accounting across multiple branches into one seamless system.

### 💡 The Offline-First Superpower
Internet connections can drop, but community service cannot stop. GMWF is built **offline-first**:
- Every branch workstation continues to work without an internet connection.
- Local computers talk directly to each other over the local office Wi-Fi/LAN (using real-time WebSockets).
- As soon as the internet reconnects, all records automatically sync safely to the cloud.
